## 3d software engine
A practice project based on tutorial series:
[Tutorial series: learning how to write a 3D soft engine from scratch in C#, TypeScript or JavaScript](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/davrous/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/)

Typescript used for implementation. Goal to learn the basics of 3d rendering and low level underlying principles
of 3d before moving on to premade frameworks.
